                <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2><p style="font-size:1.35vw;">We aim to provide you with the information you need while considering a home to rent/buy.
                As a buyer or renter, our extensive review process allows for you to receive the most updated information about the property. As the property owner or 
            manager, we compile all of the important information about your home in one place, such as paint colors, appliances and date of past repairs. This is 
        so that you can stay informed about your home if you need to repair, renovate or update anything. <br> <br> Your privacy is our concern! We only show houses that 
    are currenly on the market. Other houses on our site are only viewable by the current owner/primary resident. Hidden properties can only be view through an account and 
    approved paperwork to show that you have permission to view the properties details. <br><br> Our company aims to stay away from influencing your judgement by including the price 
in our rating system for the properties. This is to ensure that you are getting the information and decided for yourself whether it is worth the price based on the merit of the home. </p>
